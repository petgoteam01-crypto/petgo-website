          Six months old already ‚Äî your puppy has grown so much!  
          As adolescence begins, emotional and psychological growth becomes just
          as important as nutrition or vaccines. This stage is about balance,
          bonding, and empathy.

          üåø The Importance of Emotional Growth
        </h4>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Dogs can‚Äôt express feelings with words, but they experience joy, anxiety,
          curiosity, and even disappointment. Emotional maturity shapes how they
          interact with people and other animals.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          <strong>Tip for Guardians:</strong> Keep daily routines predictable and
          interactions gentle. Sudden noise or inconsistency can delay emotional
          stability.
