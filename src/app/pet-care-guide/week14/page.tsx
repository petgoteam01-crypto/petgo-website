        </h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          At this exciting stage, your puppy is nearly done with core vaccinations ‚Äî meaning it‚Äôs time to
          explore the world safely and confidently. This week focuses on building trust, confidence, and
          calmness during early walks and social encounters.

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Begin with gentle indoor socialization ‚Äî let your puppy meet family members, hear everyday sounds,
          and explore safe spaces. Then, gradually move to short outdoor walks or neighborhood strolls.
          Remember, while you might imagine a movie-like walk in harmony, leash training often takes patience.
        </p>
      </section>

      {/* ===== LEASH TROUBLE ===== */}
      <section className="max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-12 bg-white p-8 rounded-2xl shadow-sm">

          Q. My puppy refuses to walk or keeps pulling on the leash. What should I do?
        </h4>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Many puppies struggle with early walks. Some freeze or resist moving, while others pull or chase
          every leaf and bug in sight. It‚Äôs completely normal ‚Äî walking on a leash is a new skill that takes
          time to learn.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Your job is to help your puppy view the leash as something comfortable and safe, not restrictive.

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-1">
            <li>Let your puppy wear their collar or harness indoors to get used to the feel.</li>
            <li>Walk around familiar areas like the living room or hallway.</li>
            <li>Reward calm walking and gentle leash behavior with treats or praise.</li>
            <li>Help them associate the leash with fun, not frustration.</li>
          </ul>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Collar:</strong> Great for small, calm puppies who already walk well. Ensure you can slip
            two fingers underneath comfortably.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Harness:</strong> Better for energetic or pulling puppies ‚Äî it distributes pressure safely
            across the chest instead of the neck.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Avoid retractable leashes during early training ‚Äî they reduce communication and make it harder for
          your puppy to sense your direction and pace.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-[#fffaf5] border border-[#e6dccf] rounded-xl p-5 mt-6">

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Each puppy learns at their own pace. Never force movement ‚Äî it can cause fear and resistance. Like
            teaching a child to ride a bike, gentle encouragement works better than pressure.
          </p>

          Q. How can I train my puppy to walk calmly beside me?
        </h4>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Begin indoors, then transition outside once they feel confident. Keep sessions short ‚Äî 5‚Äì10 minutes
          a few times daily. Reward your puppy for walking near you and responding to your pace.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-1 mb-4">
          <li>Hold treats or a toy near your leg to guide them.</li>
          <li>Stop walking when they pull or lag behind ‚Äî resume only when they return beside you.</li>
          <li>Introduce mild distractions gradually ‚Äî new sounds, people, or light traffic.</li>
          <li>Start in quiet areas before moving to busier ones.</li>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Walking together should feel like teamwork, not control. Speak softly, praise often, and let your
            puppy learn your rhythm naturally.
          </p>

        </h4>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          This is a natural part of socialization. Between 12‚Äì16 weeks, puppies are developing emotional
          stability ‚Äî so new sights or sounds can be overwhelming. Take things slow.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Sit calmly with your puppy in a quiet park or near a calm street. Let them watch, sniff, and listen.
          Praise calm behavior to help them associate the world with safety.

          <li>Use a soft tone for direction and praise focus.</li>
