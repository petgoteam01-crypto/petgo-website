        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Even after full vaccinations, some puppies may show low or no antibody response due to:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-1 mb-4">
          <li>Maternal antibodies blocking vaccine absorption.</li>
          <li>Weak immune response from health conditions.</li>
          <li>Improper storage or handling of vaccines.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          If results show low titers, your vet will recommend a booster to reinforce immunity ‚Äî a key
          step for puppies in high-risk or travel situations.

          <li>If antibody levels are low, a booster shot restores protection.</li>
          <li>
            For international travel, ensure your vet uses an approved laboratory and provides
            documentation.
