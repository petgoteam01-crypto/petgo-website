          Your puppy is now 46 weeks old ‚Äî just one month away from adulthood!
          This period is defined by boundless curiosity and overflowing energy.
          Managing that energy properly is key to raising a calm, confident,
          well-balanced dog.

          ‚ö° The Importance of Energy Expenditure
        </h4>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
          At this age, the world is an endless playground ‚Äî every leaf, sound,
          and scent is an invitation to explore. Just as a child thrives on
          active play, your puppy depends on consistent physical and mental
          engagement to stay healthy and happy.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          A short daily walk may not be enough. From your perspective, it feels
          adequate ‚Äî but from your puppy‚Äôs, it might leave too much energy
          unspent. This surplus energy needs a positive outlet before it turns
          into frustration or misbehavior.

          üö´ The Consequences of Pent-Up Energy
        </h4>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          When dogs don‚Äôt have enough opportunity to burn off energy, it doesn‚Äôt
          just vanish ‚Äî it builds up as internal stress, which inevitably shows
          up in behavior.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-1">
          <li>Destructive chewing on shoes, furniture, or fabrics</li>

          <li>Mouthing or nipping during play</li>

          The Solution: Consistent and Varied Activity
        </h4>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The key is not just long exercise sessions, but a mix of frequency,
          variety, and consistency. Provide several short bursts of movement
          throughout the day ‚Äî walks, fetch, tug games, scent puzzles, or short
          training drills.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
          When you give your dog structured outlets to release energy, you‚Äôll
          notice fewer unwanted behaviors and a calmer home atmosphere. Regular
          engagement also strengthens your bond ‚Äî your dog learns to follow your
          lead and mirror your calmness.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-1">
          <li>Two or three moderate walks per day</li>

        </h4>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
          After expending energy through play, training, and exploration, dogs
          experience true restorative sleep ‚Äî the kind that supports growth,
          recovery, and emotional balance.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Deep sleep boosts memory, improves learning, and stabilizes mood. It‚Äôs

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
          It‚Äôs perfectly normal for an 11-month-old dog to feel like a ball of
          energy. Instead of seeing this as a challenge, view it as an
          opportunity ‚Äî each walk, play session, or training game shapes your
          puppy‚Äôs future personality.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Through active engagement, you‚Äôre teaching patience, building trust,
          and creating the foundation for a well-adjusted adult dog. The time
          you invest today returns a lifetime of calm companionship.
