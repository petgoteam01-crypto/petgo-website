          Your puppy is already 50 weeks old ‚Äî almost a full year!  
          It feels like just yesterday you were bringing them home for the first
          time, and now they‚Äôre standing on the doorstep of adulthood.  
          Before stepping into their adult stage, it‚Äôs time for one last
          milestone: a comprehensive pre-adult health check.

          ü©∫ Why a Health Check Is Crucial Now
        </h4>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
          Even after vaccinations and basic puppy exams, annual check-ups remain
          one of the most powerful ways to maintain lifelong health. Regular
          wellness exams allow veterinarians to detect and prevent potential
          problems early ‚Äî before they become serious.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          For dogs under senior age (below 6‚Äì7 years), a yearly check-up is
          recommended. Think of it as your dog‚Äôs ‚Äúannual physical‚Äù ‚Äî a way to
          ensure their first steps into adulthood are healthy and strong.

          ‚úÖ The 4 Essential Checks for This Stage
        </h4>

        <div className="space-y-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          <div>
            <strong>1Ô∏è‚É£ Dental Check ‚Äì Are all adult teeth in place?</strong>
            <p>
              Your vet will confirm that all baby teeth have fallen out and that
              adult teeth are properly aligned. They‚Äôll check for plaque buildup
              or gum irritation to prevent early dental disease.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <strong>2Ô∏è‚É£ Weight & Body Condition Score (BCS)</strong>
            <p>
              Ensuring your dog is at a healthy weight now prevents joint stress
              and future metabolic issues. Your vet will use a standardized BCS
              chart to assess if your dog is underweight, overweight, or ideal.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <strong>3Ô∏è‚É£ Patellar Luxation Screening</strong>
            <p>
              A common orthopedic issue in dogs, this condition occurs when the
              kneecap slips out of position. Your vet can often detect it
              through a simple physical palpation ‚Äî no costly imaging needed.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <strong>4Ô∏è‚É£ Heartworm Test</strong>
            <p>
              A small blood test that can save your dog‚Äôs life. Even if you use
              monthly prevention, annual screening is crucial ‚Äî especially in
              mosquito-prone areas. Heartworm is preventable, but once
              contracted, it‚Äôs dangerous and difficult to treat.

          Many of these checks ‚Äî like patella exams ‚Äî can be performed quickly
          and affordably during a regular consultation. However, if your vet
          recommends bloodwork or more detailed testing, don‚Äôt be alarmed.
          Early detection saves both worry and cost down the road.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
          We know that reading veterinary test results can be confusing. Terms
          like ALT, ALP, or BUN can leave many pet parents uncertain about what
          they mean. That‚Äôs why PetGo‚Äôs <strong>Remote Veterinary Consultation</strong> service is here to help.
