          At around seven to eight months, your puppy‚Äôs curiosity and energy peak.
          Walks become more than bathroom breaks ‚Äî they‚Äôre opportunities to strengthen trust,
          teach boundaries, and build confidence in the world.

          1Ô∏è‚É£ Start with the Right Leash and Gear
        </h4>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
          Before heading out, check your walking essentials. Choose a sturdy
          4‚Äì6 ft (1.5‚Äì2 m) leash that allows movement while maintaining control.
          Avoid retractable leashes ‚Äî they reduce responsiveness and can cause injury.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
          A padded handle and chest-distributing harness protect growing joints and
          the trachea. For strong pullers, try a front-clip harness for gentle redirection.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-sm">
          üí° <strong>PetGo Tip:</strong> Keep a short backup leash in your car or bag for emergencies.
          Inspect clips and stitching regularly for safety.

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
          Even the most affectionate puppies can bolt toward distractions.
          Your goal is to teach your dog that staying near you is safest.
          Begin indoors with short recall and focus sessions:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-1 mb-3">
          <li>Say your dog‚Äôs name once.</li>
          <li>When they look at you, reward instantly with praise or a treat.</li>
          <li>Repeat several short sessions daily, then practice outside with distractions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-sm">
          üí° <strong>PetGo Tip:</strong> Never shout your dog‚Äôs name in frustration ‚Äî it should
          always mean something positive and safe.

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
          A great walk means moving together in harmony. If your puppy stiffens,
          barks, or hides when passing others, calmly move aside and reward relaxed
          behavior. Teach your dog to walk beside you ‚Äî not pull or drag.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
          Use light leash tension as gentle feedback, never punishment. Short, regular
          walks are better than occasional long ones for building calm focus.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-sm">
          üí° <strong>PetGo Tip:</strong> Aim for two 10‚Äì20 minute structured walks daily, including
          relaxed sniffing breaks to let your dog decompress.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
          Consistency builds confidence. Walks at regular times teach your dog when
          to expect activity and reduce anxiety. Begin in quiet areas, then gradually
          introduce new sounds, surfaces, and people.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
          Keep training upbeat ‚Äî mix treats, toys, and praise. End with calm standing
          time so your puppy learns that walks conclude with peaceful moments.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-sm">
          üí° <strong>PetGo Tip:</strong> In cold Canadian winters, protect paws with balm or boots,
          and shorten walks when sidewalks are icy or salted.

          A calm, responsive walker isn‚Äôt born ‚Äî they‚Äôre made through trust,
          repetition, and clear communication. When your dog walks near you,
          glances up for reassurance, and moves with ease, you‚Äôve built a bond
          based on mutual respect.

          üíõ <strong>PetGo Reminder:</strong> Every walk teaches your dog that the world is
