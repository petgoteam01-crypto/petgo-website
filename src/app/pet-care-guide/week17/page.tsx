        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Around 4 months of age, many pet parents begin asking whether to have their puppy
          neutered or spayed. This week explains what the procedure means, when it‚Äôs best done, and
          how to care for your puppy before and after surgery.

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Neutering (males) and spaying (females) remove reproductive organs to prevent unwanted
          pregnancies and reduce hormone-driven behaviors. Beyond population control, these
          procedures can lower the risk of reproductive diseases and certain tumors later in life.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Opinions differ globally, so consult your vet to make an informed decision based on your
          puppy‚Äôs breed, size, and health.

        </ul>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Timing varies by breed and maturity level. The goal is to schedule surgery before mating
          instincts develop but after sufficient growth. Your vet will determine the safest window.
