          <p>
            Chicken and rice is one of the easiest and most reliable meals you
            can prepare for your dog. It‚Äôs gentle on the stomach, naturally
            flavorful, and filled with clean protein and energy-giving grains.
            Even healthy dogs enjoy it as a ‚Äúcomfort food‚Äù on special occasions.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            At PetGo Kitchen, we love this recipe because it‚Äôs flexible and
            forgiving ‚Äî you can adjust the ingredients based on your dog‚Äôs
            size, taste, and diet. Think of it as a blank canvas for wholesome
            home-cooked meals.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            As always, speak with your veterinarian before adding new foods to
            your pet‚Äôs diet, especially if your pup has allergies or digestion
            concerns.

            üçö White or Brown Rice?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Both are perfectly safe for dogs. Brown rice offers extra fiber and
            nutrients for healthy pups, while white rice is softer and easier
            to digest ‚Äî ideal when your dog‚Äôs stomach needs a little rest.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3">
            For regular meals, brown rice adds a boost of minerals and keeps
            your dog full longer. When your pup isn‚Äôt feeling well, switch to
            plain white rice for a few days until they recover.

             How to Cook

          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3">
            <li>Warm olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add chicken and cook for about 6‚Äì8 minutes, stirring often, until no longer pink.</li>
            <li>Pour in chicken broth and rice. Stir and bring to a gentle boil.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 15‚Äì20 minutes until the rice is soft.</li>
            <li>Stir in peas, carrots, and parsley. Cook another 2‚Äì3 minutes, then let cool.</li>
          </ol>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Serve at room temperature. For a 20-pound dog, about one cup is
            plenty for a meal or treat portion.

            ‚ö†Ô∏è For Dogs with Sensitive Stomachs
          </h2>
          <p>
            When your dog isn‚Äôt feeling well, keep it extra mild: skip the oil
            and veggies, and simply boil chicken and white rice. It helps
            settle the stomach and provides light nutrition without irritation.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3">
            To boil: place chicken breasts in a pot of water or broth and cook
            for 12‚Äì15 minutes. Shred the meat, mix it with cooked white rice
            (2 parts liquid to 1 part rice), cool, and serve.

         Is It an Everyday Meal?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Chicken and rice is best served as a temporary or occasional meal.
            Dogs need a wide range of nutrients that this recipe alone doesn‚Äôt
            fully provide. If you want to move toward a home-cooked diet, ask
            your vet about supplements or balanced meal plans.

            Refrigerate leftovers for up to 3 days, or freeze in single-meal
            portions for up to 3 months. Defrost overnight in the fridge and
            warm slightly before serving.

            Keep your dog‚Äôs meals seasoning-free ‚Äî no salt, butter, or herbs

            omega-3 oil or sprinkle chia seeds once the food cools. Your pup
